## Introduction

People often think of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) of a way to safely browse the internet. However, this can be misleading sometimes. While it is true VPNs provide an additional layer of privacy to our browsing and internet experience, there are other aspects VPNs do not cover. Furthermore, most VPN services provide anonymity, but not safety. These and other topics will be discussed in this paper.

## Are they safe?

Most VPN services encrypt your network traffic, so that no one can [eavesdrop](#eavesdropping) on your online activities, not even your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or secular authorities. However, traffic encryption does not imply safety in all situations.

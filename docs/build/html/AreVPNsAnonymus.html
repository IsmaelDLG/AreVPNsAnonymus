<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A VPN (Virtual Private Network) extends a private network <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">^16</a> across a public network<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">^16</a> and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. For security, the private network connection may be established using an encrypted layered <a class="reference external" href="#tunneling-protocol">tunneling protocol</a>, and users may be required to pass various authentication methods to gain access to the VPN <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">^1</a>.  Nowadays, <a class="reference external" href="#openvpn">OpenVPN</a> is the one of the most used protocols available.</p>
<p>VPNs are often considered the key to safety and privacy while browsing the internet. However, there are some important things that we have to take into consideration when choosing a VPN if we want to enjoy safety and privacy.</p>

<div class="section" id="are-they-anonymous">
<h2>Are they anonymous<a class="headerlink" href="#are-they-anonymous" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While most VPN providers claim they do not keep logs, it is true that most companies keep basic connection logs(User <a class="reference external" href="#ip-address">IP address</a> and VPN timestamp). It is very important to check the companies privacy policy and the location of their headquarters (in terms of jurisdiction).</p>
<p>It is also important to take into account the encryption standard used. Many VPN clients allow you to choose different standards. While the securer standards may slow down the internet connection, they will make sure your data is safer.</p>
<p>Typically, your ISP (Internet Service Provider) would have to pay special attention to your activity in order to determine whether you are using a VPN or not. However, if well protected, they won’t be able to learn the nature of your activity. They are only able to see you are connected to a certain endpoint and the bandwidth you are using. If they want to learn more about you, they may request logs to your VPN provider (they probably need a court order to do that). See more information on this topics in the following subheadings.</p>
<div class="section" id="personal-information">
<h3>Personal information<a class="headerlink" href="#personal-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is well known that companies keep personal information when we use their products. Now a days, it is very common (if not obligatory) that web pages ask you to accept their privacy policy and the use they give to your data (be by using cookies or any other means). When choosing a VPN service, it is very important to read carefully the privacy policy of that company in order to be aware of the data they store about us. It would make no sense that we used a VPN to hide our personal data ( <a class="reference external" href="#ip-address">IP</a>, billing information, name, …) but the VPN itself stores and uses that information!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="different-levels-of-logging">
<h3>Different levels of logging<a class="headerlink" href="#different-levels-of-logging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Companies may have different logging levels. These are the three main categories:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Usage (browsing) logs</strong> – These logs basically include online activity: browsing history, connection times, <a class="reference external" href="#ip-address">IP addresses</a>, metadata, etc. From a privacy standpoint, you should avoid any VPN that collects usage data. Most of the VPN services that are collecting usage logs are free VPN apps, which are basically spyware. The data they collect is then sold to third parties, thereby monitoring the “free VPN” service.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Connection logs</strong> – Connection logs typically include dates, times, connection data, and sometimes <a class="reference external" href="#ip-address">IP addresses</a>. Typically this data is used for optimizing the VPN network and potentially dealing with user problems or terms of use issues (torrenting, illegal activities, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No logs</strong> – No logs simply means the VPN service is not keeping any logs whatsoever. Having a truly no logs policy can be difficult to implement while at the same time enforcing restrictions, such as device connections or bandwidth. This is especially the case when VPNs need to enforce restrictions such as bandwidth or the number of devices being used per subscription.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>While basic connection logs are not necessarily a problem, there is an increasing number of VPNs that keep connection logs, while falsely claiming to be a “no logs” service. Examples of this are Betternet, PureVPN, Windscribe, and TunnelBear. That is why it is very important to be aware of our VPN provider’s privacy policy and the jurisdiction of their headquarters <a class="reference external" href="https://pixelprivacy.com/vpn/no-log-vpn/">^7</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-encryption">
<h3>Data encryption<a class="headerlink" href="#data-encryption" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Essentially, data encryption provides users with a secure VPN tunnel whereby data is protected. However, there are different levels of encryption as well. By default <a class="reference external" href="#openvpn">OpenVPN</a> includes AES-128 <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">^8</a>, SHA-1 <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">^9</a>, and RSA-2048 <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">^10</a>, while maximum encryption includes AES-256 <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">^8</a>, SHA-256 <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">^11</a>, and RSA-4096 <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">^10</a>. An <a class="reference external" href="#encryption-key">encryption key</a> tells your computer how to decrypt or encrypt data.</p>
<p>Data authentication is part of the encryption process and refers to the message authentication algorithm with which user data is authenticated. This is used to protect users from active <a class="reference external" href="#security-attacks">security attacks</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="further-considerations">
<h3>Further considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#further-considerations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>VPN servers <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">^28</a> may use static or dynamic <a class="reference external" href="#ip-address">IP addresses</a>. The later are the most common used. There are pros and cons for both approaches, and they can be important to the user depending on the use given to the VPN (and the budget available).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Dynamic <a class="reference external" href="#ip-address">IP address</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pros - They provide greater anonymity for public WiFi hotspots, for they implement <a class="reference external" href="#nat">NAT</a> and offer a wider range of <a class="reference external" href="#ip-address">IPs</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Cons - <a class="reference external" href="#ip-address">IPs</a> can be abused by other users of the network<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">^16</a>, be it by spamming or hacking. This can lead to being banned from certain websites, or being suspicious of illegal activity.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Static <a class="reference external" href="#ip-address">IP address</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pros - Unique <a class="reference external" href="#ip-address">IP</a> for user. Harder to block by ISP or Network Administrators, since they use their own ports.</p></li>
<li><p>Cons - Expensive.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some VPN servers <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">^28</a> offer built-in <a class="reference external" href="#dns">DNS</a> protection. This happens because there is a well-know flaw in some operative systems that, despite having routed the traffic through a VPN server <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">^28</a>, keep contacting websites using their original <a class="reference external" href="#ip-address">IP</a> and <a class="reference external" href="#dns">DNS</a>. This is a treat to your online security, anonymity and usefulness of your VPN. Altough these <a class="reference external" href="#dns">DNS</a> leaks can be prevented, it can be worth looking for a VPN with built-in protection.</p>
<p>Notice that using a VPN does not protect you from malicious software. While some VPN providers offer additional protection, most do not. Viruses, spyware and malware can still harm you when you are using a VPN.</p>
<p>Many VPN offer anonymous payment options, like Bitcoin, Altcoins, Alipay, CashU, PaySafeCard, Gift Cards and others. These can be an extra anonymity layer to take into account.</p>
<p>Deep packet inspection (DPI) <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection">^21</a> or packet sniffing is a type of data processing that inspects in detail the data being sent over a computer network <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">^16</a>, and usually takes action by blocking, re-routing, or logging it accordingly.  It is used by ISPs, government agencies, and hackers to monitor and retain all of the data transmitted to and from your computer, including confidential and private information. To help customers bypass this, VPN providers are actively implementing modified OpenVPN protocols with added obfuscation layers, which masks VPN traffic away from view of DPI crawls. Check your VPN provider on this topic.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="free-or-paid-vpns">
<h2>Free or Paid VPNs<a class="headerlink" href="#free-or-paid-vpns" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Free VPN services normally offer slower bandwidth and a smaller server <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">^28</a> range. It is also important to consider that everyone wants to make a living, so while they claim to be free, they may make money using other means, which, in some cases, compromise the users confidentiality ( see the case of <a class="reference external" href="#Hola-VPN">Hola</a> in the appendix ).</p>
<p>A legitimate and reliable paid VPN service offers several advantages, including a much more private environment, authentic guarantees, faster speeds, more servers <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">^28</a>, more extra features and add-on services, as well as being less likely to log traffic or connection logs. Normally, and given that you pay for them, they are more likely to be safe compared to free services.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="can-i-be-tracked-while-using-a-vpn">
<h2>Can I be tracked while using a VPN<a class="headerlink" href="#can-i-be-tracked-while-using-a-vpn" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Strictly speaking, using a personal VPN does not prevent others from tracking you fully. Some tracking techniques can go through a VPNs layer of privacy and still identify you while browsing the internet. Some of this practices are simple, some others are more complicated. Common tracking practices that are not stopped while using a VPN will be considered in the following subheadings.</p>
<div class="section" id="tracking-cookies">
<h3>Tracking cookies<a class="headerlink" href="#tracking-cookies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>While using a VPN can hide your <a class="reference external" href="#ip-address">IP address</a> from the internet, <a class="reference external" href="#cookies">cookies</a> can still track your activity. Tracking <a class="reference external" href="#cookies">cookies</a> are not blocked by your VPN when browsing the internet, and they are not removed from your system afterwards either. However, your web browser <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">^27</a> can do that for you. Every web browser <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">^27</a> can block third-party <a class="reference external" href="#cookies">cookies</a> and remove all of them after the browsing session has finished (when you exit the browser <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">^27</a>), and if yours does not, you should think about changing your web browser <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">^27</a>. Sometimes this is as simple as browsing in incognito mode <a class="reference external" href="https://vpnpros.com/blog/how-cookies-affected-by-vpn/">^24</a>.</p>
<p>A VPN, however, can help in the sense that it will hide from cookies your real <a class="reference external" href="#ip-address">IP address</a>, since the VPN server <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">^28</a> is the one connecting to the internet. Therefore, <a class="reference external" href="#ip-address">IP</a> based identification will not work on you. But all the other information will be there: browsing history, queries performed, preferences…</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="referrer-urls">
<h3>Referrer URLs<a class="headerlink" href="#referrer-urls" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A referrer URL is the web address of the previous website where you clicked a link to get to the current website. These can be used for several reasons, and recording your browser <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">^27</a> history is one of them. They are often used alongside with <a class="reference external" href="#cookies">cookies</a>, but these are not required in order to use referrer URLs. If someone clicks on a link to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">example.org</span></code> at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">example.com/links.htm</span></code>, then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">example.org's</span></code> visitor log will show <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">example.com/links.htm</span></code> as his referral URL <a class="reference external" href="https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-is-a-referral-url">^25</a>.</p>
<p>Some web browsers <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">^27</a> have an option not to send referral URL information to websites. Generally speaking, VPNs do not do that. Users may also do this manually by copying the link address and pasting it into the browser’s <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">^27</a> address bar.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="web-beacons">
<h3>Web beacons<a class="headerlink" href="#web-beacons" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A web beacon is a technique used on web pages and email to unobtrusively (usually invisibly) allow checking that a user has accessed some content <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_beacon">^26</a>. The first web beacons were small digital image files that were embedded in a web page or email. The image could be as small as a single pixel, and could be of the same color as the background, or completely transparent (thus the name “tracking pixel”). When a user opens the page or email where such an image was embedded, they might not see the image, but their web browser<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">^27</a> or email reader would automatically download the image, requiring the user’s computer to send a request to the host company’s server <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">^28</a>, where the source image was stored. This request would provide identifying information about the computer, allowing the host to keep track of the user.</p>
<p>The identifying information provided by the user’s computer typically includes its <a class="reference external" href="#ip-address">IP address</a>, the time the request was made, the type of web browser or email reader that made the request, and the existence of <a class="reference external" href="#cookies">cookies</a> previously sent by the host server. The host server can store all of this information, and associate it with a <a class="reference external" href="#session-id">session identifier</a> or tracking token that uniquely marks the interaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="browser-fingerprinting">
<h3>Browser fingerprinting<a class="headerlink" href="#browser-fingerprinting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A device fingerprint, machine fingerprint or browser fingerprint is information collected about a remote computing device for the purpose of identification.

<h3>Cookie syncing<a class="headerlink" href="#cookie-syncing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The biggest problem <a class="reference external" href="#cookies">cookies</a> face is that they can only be read on the domain that created them. This means that AdTech companies can’t read cookies created by other AdTech platforms or by the website itself, essentially limiting their effectiveness for advertising purposes on other websites. This is faced by creating a unique identifier (UID) for each user and sharing it with other companies, like a translation table that gathers each companies ID of that user and translates it to a UID.</p>

<h3>Supercookies<a class="headerlink" href="#supercookies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Supercookies are not stored in your computer. Instead, an ISP inserts a piece of information unique to a user’s connection into the HTTP header. They are injected at the network level as Unique Identifier Headers (UIDH). This means clearing your browser data will not delete that cookie. Blockers can’t block it either.</p>
<p>A zombie cookie remains intact as it hides outside of your browser’s regular cookie storage. Zombie cookies target local storage, HTML5 storage, RGB color code values, Silverlight storage, and more. That’s why they’re known as zombie cookies. An advertiser must only find an existing cookie in one of those locations to resurrect the rest.</p>
<p>If an ISP decides to track you with supercookies, there is not really much you can do, except encrypting your traffic ( so that at least, they do not know what you are doing ). This can be done by using HTTPS-only websites, and by using a VPN. However, the last if the safer option.</p>

<h3>OpenVPN<a class="headerlink" href="#openvpn" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>OpenVPN is open-source software (there is a commercial version and a free edition) that implements virtual private network (VPN) techniques to create secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities. It uses a custom security protocol that utilizes SSL/TLS for key exchange. It is capable of traversing network address translators (NATs) and firewalls.</p>
<p>OpenVPN allows peers to authenticate each other using pre-shared secret keys, certificates or username/password (this part requires third party modules). When used in a multi client-server <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-server">^22</a> configuration, it allows the server <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">^28</a> to release an authentication certificate for every client, using signatures and certificate authority. It uses the OpenSSL encryption library extensively, as well as the TLS protocol, and contains many security and control features.</p>
<p>OpenVPN uses the OpenSSL library to provide encryption of both the data and control channels. It lets OpenSSL do all the encryption and authentication work, allowing OpenVPN to use all the ciphers available in the OpenSSL package. It can also use HMAC packet authentication feature to add an additional layer of security. Mbed TLS is available starting from version 2.3 <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVPN">^6</a>.</p>

<li><p><strong>Passive attacks</strong> - A Passive attack attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources. Passive Attacks are in the nature of eavesdropping on or monitoring of transmission. The goal of the opponent is to obtain information is being transmitted.</p></li>

<h3>Hola VPN<a class="headerlink" href="#hola-vpn" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Hola, based out of Israel, is mainly a free VPN service. It also offers paid subscriptions. Hola was the first <a class="reference external" href="#p2p">P2P</a> based VPN service created. But this VPN services did not become famous for its good things, but for its bad things. According to their privacy policy, we can say the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Location of their headquarters</strong> - They are located in Israel, outside the 14-Eyes Countries and Jurisdiction <a class="reference external" href="https://thebestvpn.com/5-9-14-eyes-countries/">^18</a>. However, Israel is cooperative with this alliance, where they share all their espionage information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Logging level</strong> - They log the following data: browser <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">^27</a> type, web pages visited, time spent on this pages, access times and dates. We could say they know nearly everything about your internet activity. They store <strong>usage logs</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Personal data</strong> - They store your <a class="reference external" href="#ip-address">IP address</a>, name, email and they may share it “subsidiaries and affiliated companies”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Encryption level</strong> -  Non-existent. Hola VPN uses a proxy tunnel, transmitting information in plain text.</p></li>

<p>No, specially for free users. Take into consideration that, when using this VPN, other users can use your computer bandwidth for illegal purposes!

<h3>P2P<a class="headerlink" href="#p2p" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equally potent participants in the application. They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes. P2P was popularized by the music-sharing application Napster, and it is the root of file-sharing and torrenting.</p>
<p><img alt="P2P-network" src="Images/AreVPNsAnonymus/P2P-network.png" /></p>
<p>Peers make a portion of their resources, such as processing power, disk storage or network bandwidth, directly available to other network participants, without the need for central coordination by servers <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">^28</a> or stable hosts. Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the traditional client-server <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-server">^22</a> model in which the consumption and supply of resources is divided <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">^13</a>.</p>

<p>Network address translation (NAT) <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">^19</a> is a method of remapping an <a class="reference external" href="#ip-address">IP address</a> space (a range of discrete IP addresses) into another by modifying the identifier of the network interface or host in the packet in transit across a routing device. IP masquerading, similar to NAT, consists on hiding an entire address space behind a single <a class="reference external" href="#ip-address">IP address</a>. This is used in common routers, so that all the devices connected to the network share one public <a class="reference external" href="#ip-address">IP address</a>.</p>

<h3>Cookies<a class="headerlink" href="#cookies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An HTTP cookie is a small piece of data stored on the user’s computer by the web browser <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">^27</a> while browsing a website. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information, as the HTTP protocol does not. However, not all cookies have innocent intentions. Tracking cookies, and specially third-party tracking cookies are commonly used as ways to compile long-term records of individuals’ browsing histories, and therefore can violate the users’ privacy online <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">^23</a>.</p>
<p>Normally a cookie’s domain attribute will match the domain shown in the web browser’s <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">^27</a> address bar. Third-party cookies do not, since they belong to a different domain.  This sort of cookie typically appears when a web page features content from external websites, as ads.</p>
<p>As an example, suppose a user visits a website <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">www.example.org</span></code>. This website contains an ad that sets a cookie from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ad.foo.com</span></code>. So, when the website <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">www.example.org</span></code> is loaded, the cookie from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ad.foo.com</span></code> is stored in the user’s computer. When the user visits a second website called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">www.secondexample.com</span></code> that contains another ad from the same domain as the first one (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ad.foo.com</span></code>), the cookie set in the first example is sent to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ad.foo.com</span></code> and a second cookie is set in that website. Therefore, the domain <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ad.foo.com</span></code> knows that user has visited the websites <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">www.example.org</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">www.secondexample.com</span></code>.</p>

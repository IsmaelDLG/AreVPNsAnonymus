First thing I will do Is download different VPN services, install them and download the pages I get to look for JS Injection.

Used VPNs:
- Full VPNS:
    - ProtonVPN
    - Windscribe
- Browser VPN:
    - Browsec WPN
    - Hola Free VPN
    - Hotspot Shield Free
    - Hoxx VPN
    - SetupVPN
    - Surshark VPN
    - Touch VPN
    - uVPN
    - VPN
    - VPN Free
    - VPN Master
    - ZenMate Free

1. I used the crawlers to download the top 500 pages while using the full VPN.
2. I used an extension called SingleFile to download pages using the web browser VPNs, this was donw manually.
